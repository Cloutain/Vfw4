Vfw4 is a Win32 API C++ application written by me ( Percy Tierney ) as a "Final Exam" when I finished the textbook 
"C++ Primer", Fourth Edition, by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie and Barbara E. Moo (Addison Wesley).

The app builds in 32 and 64 bit versions and has been tested on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. 
VFW is the TLA for "Video for Windows", the first comprehensive multimedia API bundled with Windows 3.0 
Multimedia Edition, and then Windows 95. This is a Legacy API (meaning not actively updated, with minimal
support), but is still a part of Windows 10 in 16, 32 and 64 bit versions, all of which still work fine.

The purpose of this app was to solidify my knowledge of C++ with a practical project. 
The app includes its own logger class, which runs on an async thread.
The Vfw API is pretty simple, and this code is well commented.

Enjoy,
